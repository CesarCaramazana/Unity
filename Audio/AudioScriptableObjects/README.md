# An Audio Event implementation with Scriptable Objects

The [original implementation by Baruch-Adi Hen](https://gist.github.com/baruchadi/3c23caf609fa0f4bd349d9ea432eb9c4).

Here I present a simplified version, with a custom Unity editor to create the preview button in the inspector, and support for Mixer Group selection.
