# Mesh trail effect

Original source: [Gabriel Aguiar Prod.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vvycc2iX6E&ab_channel=GabrielAguiarProd.), a fantastic channel for Visual Effects. No changes were made from my part.

## The idea

This trail effect renders copies of the object's mesh in fixed time intervals by saving the position and pose of the object.



An example:
